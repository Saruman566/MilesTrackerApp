# MilesTracker

A App to Track Miles from Motorcycle by GPS and Google Location Services.

It was written for a motorcycle with a 20-liter tank.
The consumption was calculated based on moderate driving,
so that 153 miles is the maximum before the reserve kicks in.
In the lower input field, you can enter the miles already driven and confirm with Set Miles.
They are then subtracted from the maximum of 153.

For example:

Input: 44
Max: 153
Miles to start tracking: 109

From the Author:

This motorcycle is a youngtimer from America and therefore does not have an accurate fuel gauge. You have to estimate or calculate this based on the kilometers/miles driven. Hence the idea for this app. 

Have Fun.

It was written for a motorcycle from America with only displays mileage not the kilometers.
The consumption was calculated based on tank size, reserve and consumptio.
That is the maximum before the reserve kicks in.
In the lower input field, you can enter the miles already driven and confirm with Set Miles.
They are then subtracted from the maximum.

For example:

Input: 44
Max: 153
Miles to start tracking: 109

You can access the configuration page using the cog icon in the top right-hand corner.

Here you can specify the tank size, reserve and consumption per 100 km.

With this information, you can now calculate and display the new maximum mileage. 


Have Fun.
